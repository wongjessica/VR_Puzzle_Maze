VR Puzzle Maze - The Path Back Home

Creators: Jackson Lu, Alvin Rosario, Jessica Wong, Sunniyatul Quaderin

This game is a VR Puzzle Maze, that is run via the Google Cardboard. The game consists of a variety of puzzles that require different approaches to solve. We decided to go for an “escape room”-like approach. The player spawns in a room surrounded by many objects, some of which they can interact with. The rooms also have hints and follow principles of good game design by providing the player with clues to help solve the puzzles and indications about what to do next. The objective of the game is for the player to attempt to solve the puzzles which eventually leads to "escaping" each room, which conclusively leads the player to find their home, where his wife is waiting.
