GazeClick 
Google VR / Google Cardboard Extension for Timed Reticle
(c) 2018 Ateo GmbH

GazeClick adds a simple timed click functionality to the Reticle from the GoogleVR Plugin for Unity.
When the user looks at an interactive object, the timed cursor starts and as soon as the animation is finished, a click is simulated. 
This enables completely gaze-controlled VR experiences without any additional input.

Version 1.7 (Supports GoogleVR 1.7 or older).
Fully tested with Unity 5.6
Runs also in Unity 2017 and 2018 (but may need a little bit until it is all importet).

FAQ

Q:	Can I change the color of the reticle or animation time?

Q:  Can I change the standard color of the reticle?
A:  You can change it on the GvrReticleMaterial from the GoogleVR unity package.

Q: 	I’m getting an error : “The type or namespace name ‘...Gvr...’ was not found.”
A: 	GoogleVR Plugin is missing. Please import / reimport GoogleVRForUnity.

Q: 	How do I set up GoogleVR with the reticle?
A: 	Either duplicate the setup from the GoogleVR Demo scene or follow these Instructions from scratch:

Version 1.3 and older

	1) Import GoogleVR for Unity (Link: https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/)
	2) Create an EventSystem and add the GazeInputModule (GoogleVR / Scripts / GazeInputModule) to it.
	3) Be sure to have the GvrPointerManager script somewhere in your scene. It can be on an empty GameObject.
	4) Put the GvrViewerMain Prefab (GoogleVR / Prefabs) into the scene
	5) Drag the GvrReticle Prefab (GoogleVR / Prefabs / UI) onto the Main Camera

Version 1.4 and newer
	1) Import GoogleVR for Unity (Link: https://developers.google.com/vr/unity/)
	2) Drag the GvrEventSystem into the scene (GoogleVR / Prefabs / UI)
	3) Be sure to have the GvrControllerMain prefab in the scene (GoogleVR / Prefabs / Controller).
	4) Put the GvrEditorEmulator Prefab (GoogleVR / Prefabs / UI) into the scene to help you test the scene
	5) Drag the GvrReticlePointer Prefab (GoogleVR / Prefabs / UI) onto the Main Camera

	Depending on your version of GoogleVR the names of some prefabs might vary. 
	Check the Demoscenes under (GoogleVR / Demos / Scenes) to find the correct names.


Q:  Can I make certain objects interactable (click and or hover), but in a way such that GazeClick will not automatically click them?
A:  Sure you can use the IGvrGazeResponder interface on such objects. Our GazeClick will not react to such objects.

Q:  Is ther a way to hide the Reticle when not looking at an interactable object?
A:  Yes there is! In the GvrReticlePointer object in the GvrReticleMaterial change the A value of the color to 0 and change the "Reticle Growth Speed" to a higher value.
    After that go to the GazeClick object and uncheck the "Use Original Color". If needed increase the "Time Before Rotation" and the "Rotation Duration" to get more time before a click.

Q:	My GazeClick Reticle doesn’t behave properly, Animation doesn’t always play
A:	Try changing / adjusting the “Precision” value in the Advanced Options to adjust the sensivity of the GazeClick Reticle

Q:  I updated my GoogleVR version and GazeClick throws an error, what can I do?
A:  Delete your Gazeclick folder and reimport (from the unity package) the newest Version of GazeClick.

Q:  I just downloaded the newest version of GoogleVR and I get some errors using GazeClick.
A:  If you are using a version of GoogleVR which is just some days old, it might be that GazeClick is not adapted to it yet.
	Use an older version of GoogleVR for the time being and notify us via email, we might be allready working on an update.
	You can find older Versions of GoogleVR here: https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk

Q: I just downloaded the newest version of Unity and I get some errors using GazeClick.
A: It can sometimes happen, that newer versions of unity have some bugs or that some older functions are no longer supported.
   Use an older version of Unity for the time being and notify us via email, we might be allready working on an update.
